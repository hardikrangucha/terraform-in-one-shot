Terraform Learning Projects

This repository contains my hands-on learning journey with Terraform, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in automating, managing, and scaling cloud infrastructure using Terraform.

📌 Topics Covered
	•	Core Concepts – Providers, resources, variables, outputs, modules
	•	Expressions & Functions – string interpolation, loops (for_each, count), conditionals
	•	Terraform Workflow – init → plan → apply → destroy
	•	CLI & Commands – core and advanced (taint, import, state manipulation, graph`)
	•	Variables & Configurations – input, output, local, dynamic blocks
	•	State Management & Backends – remote state with AWS S3, state locking with DynamoDB
	•	Provisioners & User Data – file, local-exec, remote-exec, AWS EC2 user data
	•	Workspaces – managing multiple environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
	•	Modules – using Terraform Registry modules and creating custom reusable modules

🎯 Purpose

This repo is meant for:
	•	Practicing Terraform commands and workflows
	•	Experimenting with real-world infrastructure setups
	•	Documenting my learning journey from beginner to advanced Terraform
