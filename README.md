# 🌍 Terraform Learning Projects  

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey with Terraform**, starting from the basics and moving into advanced concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in **automating, managing, and scaling cloud infrastructure** using Terraform.
